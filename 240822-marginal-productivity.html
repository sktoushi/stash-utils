    <h1>Marginal Productivity and Ricardo's Theory</h1>
    <p>
        The equation states that inputs are optimally utilized when the last dollar spent on the purchase of each input yields the same marginal physical product. If this condition did not hold, it would be possible to alter the purchase of inputs and produce more final product with the same total costs, or, which is the same thing, to produce a given final output at lower total costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The demand for an input can now be easily derived. Demand for an input is defined as the quantities the firm would hire at various prices. Suppose we start with a firm that is hiring inputs optimally; that is, the ratios of marginal physical products to the prices of inputs are equal. If we were to lower the price of an input, the firm would use more of that input until the last dollar spent on the input gave the same marginal physical product as the last dollar spent for all other inputs. Marginal productivity theory also indicates that when firms in competitive markets are optimally hiring inputs, all inputs will receive a price equal to the value of their marginal products.
    </p>
    <p>
        These new notions concerning marginal productivity are closely related to Ricardo’s theory of land rent, as some of their originators recognized. In analyzing land rent, Ricardo reduced a three-input model to a two-input model by assuming that capital and labor are applied as if they were a single variable input to the fixed input, land, in proportions fixed by technology. To illustrate the affinity between the newly developed marginal productivity theory and Ricardo’s theory of land rent, let us consider a model with only two inputs, labor and land. In such a model, Ricardo would measure the rent of land in the way indicated in Figure 9.2.
    </p>
    <p>
        In panel (a) of Figure 9.2, the quantity of land is assumed to be the fixed input, and the quantity of labor the variable input. The curve ABM represents the marginal physical product of labor. If a quantity of labor equal to OC is used, total product is the area OABC, the sum of the marginal products. Ricardo, however, did not focus on marginal products, although he assumed a diminishing marginal product. He focused on the determination of rent. He concluded that rent would be the area DAB. Each laborer receives a wage OD = BC, and the total wage bill is the area ODBC. Subtracting total wages from total product gives the residual DAB, which goes as rent to the fixed factor of production, land.
    </p>
    <p>
        But suppose, now, that we hold the quantity of labor fixed and vary the quantity of land. This is done in panel (b) of Figure 9.2, with the curve FGN measuring the marginal physical product of land. The total product would be equal to the area OFGH, the same as the total product OABC produced in panel (a). Each unit of land would receive a rent OI = HG, and total rent would be OIGH. Wages are now measured as a residual accruing to the fixed factor, labor, and are equal to IFG.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the consequences of this new theory of marginal productivity was, thus, to reorient economic theory towards a deeper understanding of how inputs should be combined for optimal production, influencing modern economic thought on the allocation of resources.
