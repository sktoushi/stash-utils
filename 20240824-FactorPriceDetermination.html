    <h1>Understanding Factor Price Determination in Economics</h1>
    <p>The text in the image discusses a fundamental concept in economics related to the determination of prices for factors of production (like labor, land, and capital). Here's a breakdown of the explanation:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Price Adjustment:</strong> The price paid to each factor (e.g., wages for labor, rent for land) adjusts based on the supply and demand for that specific factor. This means if there's a high demand for a particular factor but limited supply, the price for that factor will increase, and vice versa.</li>
        <li><strong>Factor Demand and Marginal Product:</strong> The demand for a factor of production is determined by its marginal product, which is the additional output produced by using one more unit of that factor. For example, if adding one more worker increases the output significantly, the marginal product of labor is high, and therefore, the demand (and the price paid) for labor will be higher.</li>
        <li><strong>Equilibrium and Compensation:</strong> In a state of equilibrium, each factor is compensated according to its marginal contribution to the production of goods and services. This means that the price paid to each factor will reflect its relative productivity or contribution to the overall output.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In simpler terms, this passage explains that in a market economy, the payment to factors of production (like wages for labor) is determined by the interaction of supply and demand, with each factor being compensated based on how much it contributes to production.</p>
