            <h2>Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply</h2>
            <p>This passage discusses the concepts of Aggregate Demand (AD), Aggregate Supply (AS), and their implications for economic growth, prices, and investment.</p>

            <h3>Key Points:</h3>

            <h4>1. Shift in Aggregate Supply (AS)</h4>
            <p>The text explains that during the 1979-1980 period, the price of oil doubled, which increased energy costs and led to a leftward shift in the Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve. This shift contributed to a global recession from 1980 to 1982, especially in the United States.</p>
            <p>Higher costs for labor, raw materials, and energy generally lead to a decrease in aggregate supply, reducing economic growth and increasing prices. Conversely, lower costs for these factors lead to an increase in aggregate supply, promoting economic growth and lowering prices.</p>

            <h4>2. Impact of Productivity</h4>
            <p>Productivity is highlighted as a significant factor in shifting AS. Higher productivity shifts AS to the right, leading to higher output and lower input costs. Lower productivity shifts AS to the left, reducing output and increasing costs.</p>

            <h4>3. Investment Implications of AS Shifts</h4>
            <p>A decline in AS (leftward shift of SRAS) can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced investment in fixed-income securities due to rising output prices (inflation) and higher nominal interest rates.</li>
                <li>Reduced investment in equity securities as profit margins decline and output decreases.</li>
                <li>Increased investment in commodities, as prices and profits in commodity-based companies are likely to rise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An increase in AS (rightward shift of SRAS) due to higher productivity or lower costs is generally favorable for most asset classes other than commodities.</p>

            <h4>4. AD and AS Interactions</h4>
            <p>The text then discusses the combined effects of shifts in AD and AS on the economy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased AD and AS:</strong> Both rising AD and AS can increase real GDP, but the effect on inflation depends on the magnitude of the changes in each. If AD increases more than AS, prices rise. If AS increases more than AD, prices fall.</li>
                <li><strong>Decreased AD and Increased AS:</strong> Leads to reduced prices and possibly reduced unemployment if AS increase offsets the decrease in AD.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased AD and Decreased AS:</strong> Results in higher prices and potentially higher unemployment if AS decreases significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Decreased AD and AS:</strong> Leads to lower GDP, higher unemployment, and deflation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
            The passage explains how shifts in aggregate demand and supply affect economic growth, prices, unemployment, and investment decisions, particularly emphasizing the role of productivity and the costs of labor, raw materials, and energy.</p>
