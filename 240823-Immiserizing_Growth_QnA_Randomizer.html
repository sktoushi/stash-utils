            "What is the concept of Immiserizing Growth?": "Immiserizing growth refers to a situation where economic growth, particularly through technical progress or expansion of production, paradoxically leads to a decline in a nation's overall welfare due to adverse changes in the terms of trade.",
            "What does Figure 7.6 illustrate regarding Immiserizing Growth?": "Figure 7.6 shows the production frontier of Nation 1 before and after neutral technical progress. Despite increased productivity, the terms of trade deteriorate, leading to a decline in welfare as indicated by a lower indifference curve.",
            "Why does Immiserizing Growth occur in large countries?": "In large countries, significant increases in exports can worsen the terms of trade because global prices adjust unfavorably, especially if the demand elasticity for the country’s goods is low.",
            "What role does the elasticity of demand play in Immiserizing Growth?": "If the elasticity of demand for a country’s goods is low, increasing exports does not lead to proportionately higher revenues, which can result in a deterioration of the terms of trade and, consequently, lower welfare.",
            "How does Nation 1’s dependence on trade affect its welfare in the context of Immiserizing Growth?": "A high dependence on trade means that any deterioration in the terms of trade can significantly reduce Nation 1's welfare, even if production increases.",
            "What is the difference between the scenarios in sections 7.5 and 7.5c?": "While section 7.5 discusses Immiserizing Growth where increased production leads to lower welfare, section 7.5c illustrates a scenario where growth, focused on scarce resources like factor K, increases welfare without adverse changes in the terms of trade."

            <h2>Immiserizing Growth (Section 7.5)</h2>
            <p>Immiserizing growth refers to a situation where economic growth, particularly through technical progress or expansion of production, paradoxically leads to a decline in a nation's overall welfare. This occurs despite increases in production and exports because of adverse changes in the terms of trade.</p>

            <h3>Figure 7.6 Explanation</h3>
            <p>The figure shows the production frontier of a nation (Nation 1) before and after neutral technical progress. This technical progress increases productivity in the production of commodity X.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Production Frontier Shift:</strong> The production frontier shifts outward from \( PB = 1 \) to \( PC = rac15 \), indicating that Nation 1 can now produce more of commodity X.</li>
                <li><strong>Terms of Trade Deterioration:</strong> Despite this increase in productivity, the terms of trade for Nation 1 deteriorate drastically, moving from point B (before growth) to point C (after growth).</li>
                <li><strong>Welfare Effect:</strong> Nation 1’s welfare is negatively affected. Although increased production would typically raise welfare, the worsening terms of trade place the nation on a lower indifference curve, indicating lower welfare.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Immiserizing Growth Occurs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nation 1’s Large Scale:</strong> Significant increases in exports by a large country can worsen its terms of trade due to global price adjustments.</li>
                <li><strong>Elasticity of Demand:</strong> Low elasticity of demand for Nation 1's goods means that increased exports don’t lead to proportionately higher revenues, worsening terms of trade.</li>
                <li><strong>Dependence on Trade:</strong> High trade dependence can amplify the negative welfare impact when terms of trade deteriorate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.5c Illustration of Beneficial Growth and Trade</h3>
            <p>This section contrasts immiserizing growth with a scenario where only Nation 1's scarce factor \( K \) doubles, leading to positive welfare growth as the wealth effect is not offset by adverse changes in terms of trade.</p>
