			"The Standard for Project Management provides a basis for understanding project management [a framework or set of guidelines that helps in planning executing and closing projects] and how it enables intended outcomes [achieving the goals or results that the project aims to accomplish]. This standard applies regardless of industry [any sector of the economy such as healthcare construction or IT] location [any geographical area whether local national or international] size [the scale of the project whether small medium or large] or delivery approach [the method used to manage the project such as predictive (traditional) hybrid (a mix of traditional and agile) or adaptive (agile)]. It describes the system within which projects operate [the overall environment or context in which projects are carried out] including governance [the policies regulations functions processes and procedures that define how projects are managed] possible functions [various roles and responsibilities within the project] the project environment [the internal and external factors that influence the project] and considerations for the relationship between project management and product management [how project management (focused on executing projects) interacts with product management (focused on the lifecycle of a product)].1",
			"Outcome. An end result or consequence of a process or project [the final effect or impact of the work done]. Outcomes can include outputs and artifacts [tangible products or deliverables created during the project] but have a broader intent by focusing on the benefits and value that the project was undertaken to deliver [the positive changes or advantages that result from the project].",
			"? Portfolio. Projects programs subsidiary portfolios and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives [a collection of related initiatives that are coordinated to meet overarching goals].",
			"? Product. An artifact that is produced is quantifiable [can be measured or counted] and can be either an end item in itself or a component item [a standalone product or part of a larger product].",
			"? Program. Related projects subsidiary programs and program activities that are managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually [a group of interconnected projects and activities that are managed together to achieve greater benefits].",
			"? Project. A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product service or result [a specific time-bound effort to produce something new or different]. The temporary nature of projects indicates a beginning and an end to the project work or a phase of the project work [projects have a defined start and finish]. Projects can stand alone or be part of a program or portfolio [they can be independent or part of a larger group of initiatives].",
			"? Project management. The application of knowledge skills tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements [using expertise and resources to ensure the project meets its goals]. Project management refers to guiding the project work to deliver the intended outcomes [overseeing and directing the project to achieve its objectives]. Project teams can achieve the outcomes using a broad range of approaches (e.g. predictive hybrid and adaptive) [various methods can be used to manage the project depending on its needs].",
			"? Project manager. The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the project team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives [the individual in charge of guiding the project team to success]. Project managers perform a variety of functions such as facilitating the project team work to achieve the outcomes and managing the processes to deliver intended outcomes [they help the team work effectively and ensure the project meets its goals]. Additional functions are identified in Section 2.3 [more roles and responsibilities are detailed in a specific section of the document].2",
			"? Project team. A set of individuals performing the work of the project to achieve its objectives [a group of people working together to complete the project and meet its goals].",
			"? System for value delivery. A collection of strategic business activities aimed at building sustaining and/or advancing an organization [a framework of actions designed to enhance the organization's growth and success]. Portfolios programs projects products and operations can all be part of an organization�s system for value delivery [various initiatives and activities that contribute to the organization's overall value].",
			"? Value. The worth importance or usefulness of something [how beneficial or significant something is]. Different stakeholders perceive value in different ways [various people or groups have different views on what is valuable]. Customers can define value as the ability to use specific features or functions of a product [customers may see value in how well a product meets their needs]. Organizations can focus on business value as determined with financial metrics such as the benefits less the cost of achieving those benefits [companies may measure value by comparing the gains from an initiative to its costs]. Societal value can include the contribution to groups of people communities or the environment [value can also be seen in how an initiative benefits society or the environment].3",
			"Projects exist within a larger system such as a governmental agency organization or contractual arrangement [projects operate within a broader context that includes various types of entities and agreements]. For the sake of brevity this standard uses the term organization when referring to governmental agencies enterprises contractual arrangements joint ventures and other arrangements [to simplify the term organization is used to encompass all these different entities]. Organizations create value for stakeholders [they generate benefits for those who have an interest in the organization]. Examples of ways that projects produce value include but are not limited to:",
			"? Creating a new product service or result that meets the needs of customers or end users [developing something new that fulfills the requirements of those who will use it];",
			"? Creating positive social or environmental contributions [making a beneficial impact on society or the environment];",
			"? Improving efficiency productivity effectiveness or responsiveness [enhancing how well resources are used increasing output achieving goals more effectively or responding more quickly to needs];",
			"? Enabling the changes needed to facilitate organizational transition to its desired future state [helping the organization move towards its long-term goals];",
			"? Sustaining benefits enabled by previous programs projects or business operations [maintaining the advantages gained from earlier initiatives].4",
			"There are various components such as portfolios programs projects products and operations that can be used individually and collectively to create value [each element can contribute to value on its own or in combination with others]. Working together these components comprise a system for delivering value that is aligned with the organization�s strategy [they form a cohesive framework that supports the organization's goals]. Figure 2-1 shows an example of a system to deliver value that has two portfolios comprised of programs and projects [illustrates a structure with two main groups containing various initiatives]. It also shows a stand-alone program with projects and stand-alone projects not associated with portfolios or programs [depicts independent initiatives that are not part of larger groups]. Any of the projects or programs could include products [these initiatives may produce tangible items]. Operations can directly support and influence portfolios programs and projects as well as other business functions such as payroll supply chain management and so forth [day-to-day activities can impact and be impacted by various initiatives and business processes]. Portfolios programs and projects influence each other as well as operations [they interact and affect one another].",
			"As shown in Figure 2-2 a system for value delivery is part of an organization�s internal environment that is subject to policies procedures methodologies frameworks governance structures and so forth [the internal context includes rules processes and structures that guide operations]. That internal environment exists within the larger external environment which includes the economy the competitive environment legislative constraints etc. [the broader context encompasses economic conditions market competition legal regulations and more]. Section 2.4 provides more detail on internal and external environments [additional information is available in a specific section of the document].5",
			"The components in a value delivery system create deliverables used to produce outcomes [the tangible products or results generated by the system lead to the final effects or impacts]. An outcome is the end result or consequence of a process or a project [the final effect or impact of the work done]. Focusing on outcomes choices and decisions emphasizes the long-range performance of the project [highlighting the importance of the project's long-term success and impact]. The outcomes create benefits which are gains realized by the organization [the positive changes or advantages that result from the project]. Benefits in turn create value which is something of worth importance or usefulness [the overall worth or significance of the benefits].6",
			"A value delivery system works most effectively when information and feedback are shared consistently among all components [regular communication and updates help keep everything aligned] keeping the system aligned with strategy and attuned to the environment [ensuring that the system supports the organization's goals and adapts to external conditions].",
			"Figure 2-3 shows a model of the flow of information where black arrows represent information from senior leadership to portfolios portfolios to programs and projects and then to operations [illustrates the top-down flow of strategic information]. Senior leadership shares strategic information with portfolios [leaders provide high-level goals and directions]. Portfolios share the desired outcomes benefits and value with programs and projects [portfolios communicate what needs to be achieved and the expected benefits]. Deliverables from programs and projects are passed on to operations along with information on support and maintenance for the deliverables [completed work and instructions for upkeep are handed over to operations].",
			"The light gray arrows in Figure 2-3 represent the reverse flow of information [depicts the bottom-up flow of feedback]. Information from operations to programs and projects suggests adjustments fixes and updates to deliverables [operations provide feedback for improvements]. Programs and projects provide performance information and progress on achieving the desired outcomes benefits and value to portfolios [they report on their progress and results]. Portfolios provide evaluations on portfolio performance with senior leadership [portfolios assess their overall performance and share it with leaders]. Additionally operations provide information on how well the organization�s strategy is advancing [operations report on the effectiveness of the strategy].7",
			"2.2 ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS",
			"The governance system works alongside the value delivery system to enable smooth workflows [ensuring that tasks and processes run efficiently] manage issues [addressing and resolving problems] and support decision making [helping leaders make informed choices]. Governance systems provide a framework with functions and processes that guide activities [a structured approach to managing and overseeing tasks]. A governance framework can include elements of oversight [monitoring and supervising activities] control [regulating and directing processes] value assessment [evaluating the benefits and worth of initiatives] integration among components [ensuring different parts work together] and decision-making capabilities [the ability to make strategic choices].",
			"Governance systems provide an integrated structure for evaluating changes issues and risks associated with the environment and any component in the value delivery system [a cohesive approach to assessing and managing alterations problems and potential threats]. This includes portfolio objectives [goals of the collection of projects] program benefits [advantages gained from coordinated projects] and deliverables produced by projects [the tangible outputs of project work].",
			"Projects can operate within a program or portfolio or as a stand-alone activity [projects can be part of larger groups or independent]. In some organizations a project management office might support programs and projects within a portfolio [a dedicated team that helps manage and coordinate projects]. Project governance includes defining the authority to approve changes and make other business decisions related to the project [establishing who has the power to make decisions and changes]. Project governance is aligned with program and/or organizational governance [ensuring that project management practices are consistent with broader organizational policies and strategies].8",
			"2.3 FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS People drive project delivery [individuals are the key force behind completing projects]. They do so by fulfilling functions necessary for the project to run effectively and efficiently [they perform essential tasks to ensure the project operates smoothly]. Functions related to the project can be fulfilled by one person by a group of people or combined into defined roles [tasks can be handled by individuals teams or specific roles].",
			"Coordinating a collective work effort is extremely important to the success of any project [working together effectively is crucial for project success]. There are different types of coordination suitable for different contexts [various methods of organizing work depending on the situation]. Some projects benefit from decentralized coordination in which project team members self-organize and self-manage [team members independently manage their tasks]. Other projects benefit from centralized coordination with the leadership and guidance of a designated project manager or similar role [a central leader directs and oversees the project]. Some projects with centralized coordination can also benefit from including self-organized project teams for portions of the work [even with a central leader parts of the project can be managed independently]. Regardless of how coordination takes place supportive leadership models and meaningful continuous engagements between project teams and other stakeholders underpin successful outcomes [effective leadership and ongoing communication are key to achieving project goals].",
			"Regardless of how projects are coordinated the collective effort of the project team delivers the outcomes benefits and value [the team's combined work results in the project's success]. The project team may be supported by additional functions depending on the deliverables industry organization and other variables [extra roles may be needed based on the project's specifics]. Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.8 provide examples of functions that are often found on projects though these are not a comprehensive list [the following sections give examples of common roles but there may be others]. In addition to these functions other functions may be necessary to enable project deliverables that produce the desired outcomes [additional roles might be needed to achieve the project's goals]. The needs of the project organization and environment influence which functions are used on a project and how those functions are carried out [the specific requirements of the project and its context determine the roles and how they are performed].9",
			"2.3.1 PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION People in this function help the project team achieve the project objectives typically by orchestrating the work of the project [coordinating and managing the tasks and activities to meet the project's goals]. The specifics of how this function is carried out within the project team can vary among organizations [different organizations may implement this role in various ways] but can include leading the planning monitoring and controlling activities [overseeing the development of plans tracking progress and ensuring the project stays on course]. In some organizations this function may involve some evaluation and analysis activities as part of pre-project activities [assessing and analyzing aspects of the project before it officially starts]. This function includes monitoring and working to improve the health safety and overall well-being of project team members [ensuring that team members are safe healthy and well-supported].",
			"Coordination includes consulting with executive and business unit leaders on ideas for advancing objectives improving project performance or meeting customer needs [working with higher-level leaders to enhance project goals performance and customer satisfaction]. It can also include assisting in business analysis tendering and contract negotiations and business case development [helping with analyzing business needs negotiating contracts and creating business cases].",
			"Oversight can be involved in follow-on activities related to benefits realization and sustainment after the project deliverables are finalized but before formal closure of the project [continuing to ensure benefits are achieved and maintained after the project is completed but before it is officially closed]. This function can support portfolios and programs within which the project is initiated [providing assistance to larger groups of projects and programs]. Ultimately the function is tailored to fit the organization [customized to meet the specific needs of the organization].10",
			"2.3.2 PRESENT OBJECTIVES AND FEEDBACK",
			"People in this function contribute perspectives insights and clear direction from customers and end users [they provide valuable input and guidance based on the needs and experiences of those who will use the project's deliverables]. The customer and end user are not always synonymous [these terms refer to different groups]. For the purpose of this standard the customer is defined as the individual or group who has requested or is funding the project [the person or entity that initiates or finances the project]. The end user is the individual or group who will experience the direct use of the project deliverable [the people who will actually use the product or service created by the project].",
			"Projects need clear direction from customers and end users regarding project requirements outcomes and expectations [specific guidance on what the project should achieve and how it should perform]. In adaptive and hybrid project environments the need for ongoing feedback is greater because the project teams are exploring and developing product elements within specific increments [continuous input is crucial as teams work on different parts of the project in stages]. In some project environments the customer or end user engages with the project team for periodic review and feedback [they regularly check in and provide input]. In some projects a representative of the customer or client participates on the project team [a customer or client representative is directly involved in the project]. The customer and end user input and feedback needs are determined by the nature of the project and the guidance or direction required [the type of project and the level of input needed dictate how feedback is gathered and used].11",
			"2.3.3 FACILITATE AND SUPPORT",
			"The function of facilitation and support may be closely related to providing oversight and coordination depending on the nature of the project [these roles can overlap especially in projects requiring close management]. The work involves encouraging project team member participation collaboration and a shared sense of responsibility for the work output [motivating team members to engage work together and take collective ownership of the project's results]. ",
			"Facilitation helps the project team create consensus around solutions resolve conflicts and make decisions [guiding the team to agree on solutions address disagreements and make choices]. Facilitation is also required to coordinate meetings and contribute in an unbiased way to the advancement of project objectives [organizing meetings and providing impartial input to help achieve project goals].",
			"Supporting people through change and helping address obstacles that can prevent success is also required [assisting team members in adapting to changes and overcoming challenges]. This can include evaluating performance and providing individuals and project teams with feedback to help them learn adapt and improve [assessing how well team members are doing and giving constructive feedback to foster growth and improvement].",
			"2.3.4 PERFORM WORK AND CONTRIBUTE INSIGHTS",
			"This group of people provides the knowledge skills and experience necessary to produce the products and realize the outcomes of the project [they bring the expertise needed to create deliverables and achieve project goals]. Work can be full time or part time for the duration of the project or for a limited period [team members may work on the project either continuously or for specific phases] and the work can be colocated or virtual depending on the environmental factors [work can be done in the same location or remotely based on the project's context]. Some work can be highly specialized [requiring specific expertise] while other work can be done by project team members who have broad skill sets [general tasks that can be handled by versatile team members].",
			"Gaining insights from cross-functional project team members representing different parts of the organization can provide a mix of internal perspectives [diverse viewpoints from various departments] establish alliances with key business units [build partnerships within the organization] and encourage project team members to act as change agents within their functional areas [motivate team members to drive change in their respective departments]. This work can extend into support functions (during or after the project) as the project deliverables are implemented or transitioned into operations [support may continue as deliverables are put into use or integrated into regular operations].",
			"2.3.5 APPLY EXPERTISE",
			"People in this function provide the knowledge vision and expertise in a specific subject for a project [they bring specialized skills and insights to the project]. They offer advice and support throughout the organization [they help guide and assist various parts of the organization] and contribute to the project team’s learning process and work accuracy [they help the team learn and ensure the work is done correctly]. These people can be external to the organization or can be internal project team members [they can be outside consultants or part of the internal team]. They can be required for the whole project or during a specific time frame [they may be needed for the entire duration of the project or just for certain periods].",
			"2.3.6 PROVIDE BUSINESS DIRECTION AND INSIGHT",
			"People in this function guide and clarify the direction of the project or product outcome [they help determine and communicate the project's goals and how to achieve them]. This function involves prioritizing the requirements or backlog items based on business value dependencies and technical or operational risk [deciding which tasks are most important based on their value relationships to other tasks and potential risks]. People in this function provide feedback to project teams and set direction for the next increment or element to be developed or delivered [they give input to the team and outline the next steps]. The function involves interacting with other stakeholders customers and their project teams to define the product direction [working with various parties to shape the project's path]. The goal is to maximize the value of the project deliverable [ensuring the final product is as valuable as possible].",
			"In adaptive and hybrid environments direction and insight can be provided using a specific cadence [regular intervals for feedback and guidance]. In predictive environments there can be designated checkpoints for presentation of and feedback on project progress [set times for reviewing and discussing progress]. In some instances business direction can interact with funding and resourcing functions [business guidance may also involve decisions about budget and resources].",
			"2.3.7 PROVIDE RESOURCES AND DIRECTION",
			"People in this function promote the project and communicate the organization’s vision goals and expectations to the project team and broader stakeholder community [they ensure everyone understands the project's purpose and objectives]. They advocate for the project and the project team by helping to secure the decisions resources and authority that allow project activities to progress [they support the team by obtaining necessary approvals resources and permissions].",
			"People in this function serve as liaisons between senior management and the project team [they act as intermediaries] play a supporting role in keeping projects aligned to business objectives [they help ensure the project stays on track with the organization's goals] remove obstacles and address issues outside the bounds of the project team’s decision authority [they solve problems that the team cannot handle alone]. People in this function provide an escalation path for problems issues or risks that project teams cannot resolve or manage on their own such as a shortage of funding or other resources or deadlines that cannot be met [they offer a way to escalate and resolve major issues like funding shortages or missed deadlines].",
			"This function can facilitate innovation by identifying opportunities that arise within the project and communicating these to senior management [they help foster new ideas and share them with leaders]. People in this function may monitor project outcomes after project closure to ensure the intended business benefits are realized [they continue to track the project's success even after it is completed to ensure it delivers the expected benefits].",
			"2.3.8 MAINTAIN GOVERNANCE",
			"People who fill a governance function approve and support recommendations made by the project team [they endorse and back the team's suggestions] and monitor project progress in achieving the desired outcomes [they track how well the project is meeting its goals]. They maintain linkages between project teams and strategic or business objectives that can change over the course of the project [they ensure the project stays aligned with the organization's evolving goals and strategies].",
			"Factors internal to the organization can arise from the organization itself a portfolio a program another project or a combination of these [internal factors can originate from various sources within the organization]. They include artifacts practices or internal knowledge [these factors encompass tangible items established methods and accumulated insights]. Knowledge includes lessons learned as well as completed artifacts from previous projects [past experiences and finished products contribute to organizational knowledge]. Examples include but are not limited to:",
			"▶ Process assets. Process assets may include tools methodologies approaches templates frameworks patterns or PMO resources [resources and methods used to manage and execute projects].",
			"▶ Governance documentation. This documentation includes policies and processes [written guidelines and procedures that govern project activities].",
			"▶ Data assets. Data assets may include databases document libraries metrics data and artifacts from previous projects [collections of information and records from past initiatives].",

			"▶ Security and safety. Security and safety measures may include procedures and practices for facility access data protection levels of confidentiality and proprietary secrets [protocols to ensure the safety and security of people and information].",
			"▶ Organizational culture structure and governance. These aspects of an organization include the vision mission values beliefs cultural norms leadership style hierarchy and authority relationships organizational style ethics and code of conduct [the overall environment and guiding principles of the organization].",
			"▶ Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. These resources include work locations virtual project teams and shared systems [the physical and virtual locations where work is done and resources are shared].",
			"▶ Infrastructure. Infrastructure consists of existing facilities equipment organizational and telecommunications channels information technology hardware availability and capacity [the physical and technological foundation that supports the organization].",
			"▶ Information technology software. Examples include scheduling software configuration management systems web interfaces to online automated systems collaboration tools and work authorization systems [software tools used to manage and coordinate project activities].",
			"▶ Resource availability. Examples include contracting and purchasing constraints approved providers and subcontractors and collaboration agreements [the availability of necessary resources including people and materials and any limitations or agreements related to their use].",
			"▶ Employee capability. Examples include general and specialized expertise skills competencies techniques and knowledge [the abilities and knowledge of the organization's workforce].",
			"Factors external to the organization can enhance constrain or have a neutral influence on project outcomes [external elements can positively negatively or neutrally impact the project's success]. Examples include but are not limited to:",
			"▶ Marketplace conditions. Marketplace conditions include competitors market share brand recognition technology trends and trademarks [the competitive landscape market position brand awareness technological advancements and intellectual property].",
			"▶ Social and cultural influences and issues. These factors include political climate regional customs and traditions public holidays and events codes of conduct ethics and perceptions [the societal and cultural context including politics local customs holidays ethical standards and public opinions].",

			"▶ Physical environment. The physical environment pertains to working conditions and weather [the physical conditions and climate affecting the work environment].",
			"2.5 PRODUCT MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS",
			"The disciplines of portfolio program project and product management are becoming more interlinked [these areas are increasingly connected and integrated]. While portfolio program and product management are beyond the scope of this standard [this document does not cover these areas in detail] understanding each discipline and the relationships between them provides a useful context for projects whose deliverables are products [knowing how these areas interact helps in managing product-related projects].",
			"A product is an artifact that is produced is quantifiable and can be either an end item itself or a component item [a product is a tangible item that can be measured and can be a standalone product or part of a larger product]. Product management involves the integration of people data processes and business systems to create maintain and develop a product or service throughout its life cycle [managing a product involves coordinating various elements to ensure its development and maintenance over time]. The product life cycle is a series of phases that represents the evolution of a product from introduction through growth maturity and to retirement [the stages a product goes through from launch to discontinuation].",
			"Product management may initiate programs or projects at any point in the product life cycle to create or enhance specific components functions or capabilities (see Figure 2-4) [new initiatives can be started at any stage to improve the product]. The initial product may begin as a deliverable of a program or project [the product might start as a result of a specific initiative]. Throughout its life cycle a new program or project may add or improve specific components attributes or capabilities that create additional value for customers and the sponsoring organization [ongoing initiatives can enhance the product to increase its value]. In some instances a program can encompass the full life cycle of a product or service to manage the benefits and create value for the organization more directly [a program might oversee the entire product life cycle to ensure it delivers maximum value].",
			"Product management can exist in different forms including but not limited to:",
			"▶ Program management within a product life cycle. This approach incorporates related projects subsidiary programs and program activities [combining various initiatives to manage different phases of a product's life cycle]. For very large or long-running products one or more product life cycle phases may be sufficiently complex to merit a set of programs and projects working together [complex products may require multiple coordinated initiatives].",
			"▶ Project management within a product life cycle. This approach oversees development and maturing of product capabilities as an ongoing business activity [continuously improving and developing the product]. Portfolio governance charters individual projects as needed to perform enhancements and improvements or to produce other unique outcomes [initiating specific projects to make improvements or achieve particular results].",
			"▶ Product management within a program. This approach applies the full product life cycle within the purview and boundaries of a given program [managing the entire product life cycle within a single program]. A series of subsidiary programs or projects will be chartered to achieve specific benefits for a product [initiating related programs or projects to enhance the product]. Those benefits can be enhanced by applying product management competencies like competitive analysis customer acquisition and customer advocacy [using skills such as market analysis attracting customers and representing customer interests].",
			"While product management is a separate discipline with its own body of knowledge [it has its own specialized knowledge and practices] it represents a key integration point within the program management and project management disciplines [it connects and integrates with program and project management]. Programs and projects with deliverables that include products use a tailored and integrated approach that incorporates all of the relevant bodies of knowledge and their related practices methods and artifacts [they use a customized approach that combines various knowledge areas and practices].",
			"▶ Responsibility [being accountable for one's actions] ▶ Respect [valuing others and treating them with dignity] ▶ Fairness [making decisions impartially and justly] and ▶ Honesty [being truthful and transparent].",
			"The principle labels are listed here without any specific weighting or order [they are not ranked by importance]. The principle statements are presented and described in Sections 3.1 through 3.12 [each principle is detailed in the following sections]. Each section begins with a figure that provides the principle label across the top with the principle and key points under the label [a visual summary of the principle and its main points]. Following the figure each principle is elaborated in the text [a detailed explanation is provided after the figure]. The principle labels are:",
			"▶ Be a diligent respectful and caring steward (see Section 3.1) [act responsibly show respect and care for resources and people].",

			"▶ Navigate complexity (see Section 3.9) [manage and simplify complex aspects of the project].",
			"▶ Optimize risk responses (see Section 3.10) [improve how risks are identified and managed].",
			"▶ Embrace adaptability and resiliency (see Section 3.11) [be flexible and able to recover from setbacks].",
			"▶ Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state (see Section 3.12) [facilitate changes needed to reach the project's goals].",
			"Stewards act responsibly to carry out activities with integrity [honesty and strong moral principles] care [attention and consideration] and trustworthiness [reliability and dependability] while maintaining compliance with internal and external guidelines [following rules and regulations both within the organization and from outside sources]. They demonstrate a broad commitment to financial social and environmental impacts of the projects they support [they are dedicated to considering the economic societal and ecological effects of their work]. Stewardship encompasses responsibilities within and external to the organization [it includes duties both inside and outside the organization].",
			"Stewardship includes:",
			"- Integrity [acting with honesty and strong moral principles]",
			"- Care [showing attention and consideration]",
			"- Trustworthiness [being reliable and dependable] and",
			"- Compliance [following rules and regulations].",
			"A holistic view of stewardship considers financial social technical and sustainable environmental awareness [it takes into account economic societal technical and ecological factors].",
			"Stewardship has slightly different meanings and applications in different contexts [it varies depending on the situation]. One aspect of stewardship involves being entrusted with the care of something [being responsible for looking after something]. Another aspect focuses on the responsible planning use and management of resources [carefully managing and using resources]. Yet another aspect means upholding values and ethics [maintaining moral principles and standards].",
			"Stewardship encompasses responsibilities both within and external to the organization [it includes duties inside and outside the organization]. Within the organization stewardship includes:",
			"▶ Operating in alignment with the organization its objectives strategy vision mission and sustainment of its long-term value [working in a way that supports the organization's goals and long-term success];",

			"▶ Understanding the appropriate use of authority accountability and responsibility particularly in leadership positions [knowing how to use power and responsibility effectively especially in leadership roles].",
			"Stewardship outside the organization includes responsibilities in areas such as:",
			"▶ Environmental sustainability and the organization’s use of materials and natural resources [ensuring the organization uses resources in an environmentally sustainable way];",
			"▶ Organization’s relationship with external stakeholders such as its partners and channels [managing relationships with external partners and stakeholders];",
			"▶ Impact of the organization or project on the market social community and regions in which it operates [considering how the organization or project affects the market community and regions];",
			"▶ Advancing the state of practice in professional industries [contributing to the improvement of professional practices].",
			"Stewardship reflects understanding and acceptance of trust as well as actions and decisions that engender and sustain that trust [building and maintaining trust through responsible actions and decisions]. Stewards also adhere to both implicit and explicit duties [they follow both understood and clearly stated responsibilities]. These can include the following:",
			"▶ Integrity. Stewards behave honestly and ethically in all engagements and communications [they act with honesty and strong moral principles in all interactions]. Stewards hold themselves to the highest standards and reflect the values principles and behaviors expected of those in their organization [they maintain high standards and embody the organization's values]. Stewards serve as role models building trust by living and demonstrating personal and organizational values in their engagements work activities and decisions [they set an example by consistently showing integrity in their actions]. In the project management context this duty often requires stewards to challenge team members peers and other stakeholders to consider their words and actions; and to be empathetic self-reflective and open to feedback [they encourage others to think about their behavior and be open to feedback].",
			"▶ Care. Stewards are fiduciaries of the organizational matters in their charge and they diligently oversee them [they responsibly manage and protect the organization's interests]. Higher-performing projects feature professionals who diligently oversee those matters beyond the confines of strictly defined responsibilities [successful projects have stewards who go above and beyond their basic duties]. Stewards pay close attention and exercise the same level of care over those matters as they would for their personal matters [they treat organizational matters with the same care as their own]. Care relates to the internal business affairs of the organization [it involves managing the organization's internal operations]. Care for the environment sustainable use of natural resources and concern for the conditions of people across the planet should be reflected in the organizational policies and principles [the organization should also show concern for environmental sustainability and global well-being].",
			"Projects bring about changes that may have unanticipated or unwanted consequences [projects can lead to unexpected or negative outcomes]. Project practitioners should identify analyze and manage the potential downsides of project outcomes so that stakeholders are aware and informed [they should assess and address possible negative impacts to keep stakeholders informed].",
			"Care includes creating a transparent working environment open communication channels and opportunities for stakeholders to raise concerns without penalty or fear of retribution [it involves fostering openness and allowing stakeholders to voice concerns safely].",
			"Trustworthiness. Stewards represent themselves their roles their project team and their authority accurately both inside and outside of the organization [they are honest about their responsibilities and capabilities]. This behavior allows people to understand the degree to which an individual can commit resources make decisions or approve something [it clarifies what they can and cannot do]. Trustworthiness also entails individuals proactively identifying conflicts between their personal interests and those of their organization or clients [they recognize and address potential conflicts of interest]. Such conflicts can undermine trust and confidence result in unethical or illegal behaviors create confusion or contribute to suboptimal outcomes [conflicts of interest can lead to mistrust unethical actions confusion and poor results]. Stewards protect projects from such breaches of trust [they safeguard the project from trust issues].",
			"▶ Compliance. Stewards comply with laws rules regulations and requirements that are properly authorized within or outside of their organization [they follow all relevant legal and regulatory guidelines]. However high-performing projects seek ways to integrate compliance more fully into the project culture creating more alignment with diverse and potentially conflicting guidelines [they embed compliance into the project culture to harmonize different guidelines]. Stewards strive for compliance with guidelines intended to protect them their organization their stakeholders and the public at large [they aim to follow rules that safeguard everyone involved]. In instances where stewards face conflicting guidelines or questions regarding whether or not actions or plans align with established guidelines stewards seek appropriate counsel and direction [they seek advice when guidelines conflict or are unclear].",
			"Stewardship requires leadership with transparency and trustworthiness [leading with openness and reliability]. Projects affect the lives of the people who deliver them as well as those who are affected by the project deliverables and outcomes [projects impact both the team and the end users]. Projects can have effects such as easing traffic congestion producing new medications or creating opportunities for people to interact [they can lead to positive changes like improved traffic flow new treatments or social interactions]. Those effects can produce negative impacts and consequences such as reduced green space side effects from medications or disclosure of personal information [they can also have downsides like less green space medication side effects or privacy issues]. Project teams and their organizational leaders carefully consider such factors and impacts so they can make responsible decisions by balancing organizational and project objectives with the larger needs and expectations of global stakeholders [they weigh these factors to make balanced and responsible decisions].",
			"Increasingly organizations are taking a holistic view to business that considers financial technical social and environmental performance simultaneously instead of sequentially [they are looking at all aspects of performance together rather than one at a time]. Since the world is interconnected now more than ever and has finite resources and a shared environment stewardship decisions have ramifications beyond the project [decisions made with stewardship in mind affect the broader world and its limited resources].",
			"Project teams are made up of individuals who wield diverse skills knowledge and experience [team members bring a variety of expertise and backgrounds]. Project teams that work collaboratively can accomplish a shared objective more effectively and efficiently than individuals working on their own [working together helps achieve goals faster and better]. Projects are delivered by project teams [teams are responsible for completing projects].",
			"Project teams work within organizational and professional cultures and guidelines often establishing their own “local” culture [they operate within broader organizational norms but also create their own team culture].",
			"A collaborative project team environment facilitates:",
			"- Alignment with other organizational cultures and guidelines [ensures the team’s work is consistent with the organization’s standards]",
			"- Individual and team learning and development [promotes growth and skill-building for team members] and",
			"- Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes [enables the team to perform at their best to achieve project goals].",
			"Team agreements. Team agreements represent a set of behavioral parameters and working norms established by the project team and upheld through individual and project team commitment [rules and standards for behavior that the team agrees to follow]. The team agreement should be created at the beginning of a project and will evolve over time as the project team continues to work together and identify norms and behaviors that are necessary in order to continue to work together successfully [it should be established early and adjusted as needed].",
			"▶ Organizational structures. Project teams use tailor and implement structures that help coordinate the individual effort associated with project work [they create frameworks to organize and manage tasks]. Organizational structures are any arrangement of or relation between the elements of project work and organizational processes [the way tasks and processes are organized].",
			"These structures can be based on roles functions or authority [they can be organized by job roles tasks or levels of power]. They can be defined as being external to the project tailored to fit the project context or newly designed to meet a unique project need [they can be pre-existing customized or newly created]. An authority figure may formally impose a structure or project team members may contribute to its design in alignment with organizational structures [a leader might set the structure or the team might help design it].",
			"Examples of organizational structures that can improve collaboration include but are not limited to:",
			"- Definitions of roles and responsibilities [clearly outlining what each person is responsible for]",
			"- Allocation of employees and vendors into project teams [assigning people and suppliers to teams]",
			"- Formal committees tasked with a specific objective [creating groups with specific goals] and",
			"- Standing meetings that regularly review a given topic [regularly scheduled meetings to discuss specific issues].",
			"▶ Processes. Project teams define processes that enable completion of tasks and work assignments [they establish methods to complete work]. For example project teams may agree to a decomposition process using a work breakdown structure (WBS) backlog or task board [they might use tools like WBS backlogs or task boards to organize tasks].",
			"Project teams are influenced by the culture of the organizations involved in the project the nature of the project and the environment in which they operate [they are shaped by the organization's culture the project's specifics and the working environment]. Within these influences project teams establish their own team cultures [they create their own ways of working together]. Project teams can tailor their structure to best accomplish the project objective [they can adjust their organization to meet the project's goals].",
			"By fostering inclusive and collaborative environments knowledge and expertise are more freely exchanged which in turn enable better project outcomes [creating a supportive and cooperative atmosphere helps share knowledge and improve results].",
			"Clarity on roles and responsibilities can improve team cultures [by reducing confusion and ensuring everyone knows their specific duties and expectations]. Within project teams specific tasks may be delegated to individuals or selected by project team members themselves [depending on their skills and interests]. This includes the authority accountability and responsibility related to tasks:",
			"▶ Authority. The condition of having the right within a given context to make relevant decisions establish or improve procedures apply project resources expend funds or give approvals [which means having the power to influence the project's direction and resource allocation]. Authority is conferred from one entity to another whether done explicitly or implicitly [through formal assignment or understood agreements].",
			"▶ Accountability. The condition of being answerable for an outcome [meaning that a person must justify their actions and results]. Accountability is not shared [only one person is held responsible for the outcome].",
			"▶ Responsibility. The condition of being obligated to do or fulfill something [indicating a duty to complete a task or role]. Responsibility can be shared [multiple people can work together to achieve a task].",
			"Regardless of who is accountable or responsible for specific project work a collaborative project team takes collective ownership of the project outcomes [ensuring that everyone works together towards the common goal and supports each other].",
			"A diverse project team can enrich the project environment by bringing together different perspectives [which means combining various viewpoints and ideas to enhance creativity and problem-solving]. The project team can be comprised of internal organizational staff contracted contributors volunteers or external third parties [including employees hired experts unpaid helpers or outside organizations]. Additionally some project team members join the project on a short-term basis to work on a specific deliverable while other members are assigned to the project on a longer-term basis [with some members working temporarily on specific tasks and others staying for the project's duration]. Integrating these individuals with a project team can challenge everyone involved [as it requires managing diverse working styles and expectations]. A team culture of respect allows for differences and finds ways to leverage them productively encouraging effective conflict management [by valuing diversity and using it to improve team performance].",
			"Another aspect of a collaborative project team environment is the incorporation of practice standards ethical codes and other guidelines that are part of the professional work within the project team and the organization [which means following established rules and ethical principles to guide behavior and decision-making]. Project teams consider how these guides can support their efforts to avoid possible conflict among the disciplines and the established guidelines they use [by ensuring everyone follows the same standards and reducing misunderstandings].",
			"A collaborative project team environment fosters the free exchange of information and individual knowledge [encouraging open communication and sharing of expertise]. This in turn increases shared learning and individual development while delivering outcomes [helping team members grow and improve while achieving project goals]. A collaborative project team environment enables everyone to contribute their best efforts to deliver the desired outcomes for an organization [by creating a supportive atmosphere where everyone can perform at their best]. The organization in turn will benefit from deliverables and outcomes that respect and enhance its fundamental values principles and culture [ensuring that the project's results align with the organization's core beliefs and standards].",
			"Engage stakeholders proactively and to the degree needed to contribute to project success and customer satisfaction [by actively involving them in the project process and ensuring their needs and expectations are met]. Stakeholders influence projects performance and outcomes [as their input and feedback can shape the project's direction and success]. Project teams serve other stakeholders by engaging with them [by communicating and collaborating to understand and address their concerns]. Stakeholder engagement proactively advances value delivery [by ensuring that the project delivers benefits that meet stakeholder needs].",
			"Stakeholders can be individuals groups or organizations that may affect be affected by or perceive themselves to be affected by a decision activity or outcome of a portfolio program or project [including anyone who has an interest in or is impacted by the project's results]. Stakeholders also directly or indirectly influence a project its performance or outcome in either a positive or negative way [as their support or opposition can impact the project's success].",
			"Stakeholders can affect many aspects of a project including but not limited to:",
			"▶ Scope/requirements by revealing the need to add adjust or remove elements of the scope and/or project requirements [which means identifying necessary changes to what the project will deliver].",
			"▶ Schedule by offering ideas to accelerate delivery or by slowing down or stopping delivery of key project activities [which can either speed up or delay the project timeline].",
			"▶ Cost by helping to reduce or eliminate planned expenditures or by adding steps requirements or restrictions that increase cost or require additional resources [which can either save money or increase the project's budget].",
			"▶ Project team by restricting or enabling access to people with the skills knowledge and experience needed to deliver the intended outcomes and promote a learning culture [which affects the availability of qualified team members and the team's ability to learn and grow].",
			"▶ Plans by providing information for plans or by advocating for changes to agreed activities and work [which can influence the project's strategy and execution].",
			"▶ Outcomes by enabling or blocking work required for the desired outcomes [which can either help achieve or hinder the project's goals].",
			"▶ Culture by establishing or influencing—or even defining—the level and character of engagement of the project team and broader organization [which shapes the team's working environment and overall organizational culture].",
			"▶ Benefits realization by generating and identifying long-term goals so that the project delivers the intended identified value [which ensures the project achieves its long-term objectives].",
			"▶ Risk by defining the risk thresholds of the project as well as participating in subsequent risk management activities [which helps manage potential threats to the project's success].",
			"▶ Quality by identifying and requiring quality requirements [which ensures the project's deliverables meet the necessary standards].",
			"▶ Success by defining success factors and participating in the evaluation of success [which determines how the project's achievements are measured].",
			"Stakeholders may come and go throughout the life cycle of the project [meaning their involvement can vary over time]. Additionally the degree of a stakeholder’s interest influence or impact may change over time [as their level of engagement and effect on the project can fluctuate]. Stakeholders especially those with a high degree of influence and who have an unfavorable or neutral view about a project need to be effectively engaged so that their interests concerns and rights are understood [which means actively involving them to address their issues]. The project team can then address these concerns through effective engagement and support leading to the probability of a successful project outcome [which increases the chances of project success by resolving stakeholder issues].",
			"Identifying analyzing and proactively engaging with stakeholders from the start to the end of the project helps to enable success [by ensuring that all relevant parties are involved and their needs are addressed throughout the project lifecycle]. Project teams are a group of stakeholders [meaning they are also part of the broader stakeholder community]. This group of stakeholders engages other stakeholders to understand consider communicate and respond to their interests needs and opinions [by actively seeking input and feedback from others].",
			"Effective and efficient engagement and communication include determining how when how often and under what circumstances stakeholders want to be—and should be—engaged [by planning the best ways and times to involve stakeholders]. Communication is a key part of engagement; however engagement delves deeper to include awareness of the ideas of others assimilation of other perspectives and collective shaping of a shared solution [by not only sharing information but also understanding and integrating different viewpoints to create a common goal]. Engagement includes building and maintaining solid relationships through frequent two-way communication [by regularly interacting and exchanging information]. It encourages collaboration through interactive meetings face-to-face meetings informal dialogue and knowledge-sharing activities [by using various methods to foster teamwork and information sharing].",
			"Stakeholder engagement relies heavily on interpersonal skills including taking initiative integrity honesty collaboration respect empathy and confidence [which are essential for building trust and effective relationships]. These skills and attitudes can help everyone adapt to the work and to each other increasing the likelihood of success [by creating a positive and flexible working environment].",
			"Engagement helps project teams detect collect and evaluate information data and opinions [by gathering and analyzing input from stakeholders]. This creates shared understanding and alignment which enables project outcomes [by ensuring everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals]. Additionally these activities help the project team to tailor the project to identify adjust and respond to changing circumstances [by being adaptable and responsive to new information and situations].",
			"Project teams actively engage other stakeholders throughout the project to minimize potential negative impacts and maximize positive impacts [by addressing issues early and leveraging opportunities]. Stakeholder engagements also enable opportunities for stronger project performance and outcomes in addition to increasing stakeholder satisfaction [by improving project results and meeting stakeholder expectations]. Finally engaging other stakeholders helps the project team to find solutions that may be more acceptable to a broader range of stakeholders [by considering diverse perspectives and finding common ground].",
			"Continually evaluate and adjust project alignment to business objectives and intended benefits and value [by regularly reviewing and modifying the project's goals and outcomes to ensure they match the organization's aims and deliver the expected benefits]. Value is the ultimate indicator of project success [as it measures the project's overall worth and impact]. Value can be realized throughout the project at the end of the project or after the project is complete [meaning benefits can be seen during immediately after or long after the project finishes].",
			"Value and the benefits that contribute to value can be defined in quantitative and/or qualitative terms [using measurable data or descriptive factors]. A focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the intended benefits that lead to value creation [by concentrating on achieving the desired results]. Project teams evaluate progress and adapt to maximize the expected value [by continuously assessing and adjusting their work to enhance benefits].",
			"Value including outcomes from the perspective of the customer or end user is the ultimate success indicator and driver of projects [as it reflects the satisfaction and benefits received by those who use the project's deliverables]. Value focuses on the outcome of the deliverables [by emphasizing the results produced by the project]. The value of a project may be expressed as a financial contribution to the sponsoring or receiving organization [by showing the monetary benefits gained]. Value may be a measure of public good achieved for example social benefit or the customer’s perceived benefit from the project result [by indicating the positive impact on society or customer satisfaction]. When the project is a component of a program the project’s contribution to program outcomes can represent value [by showing how it supports broader program goals].",
			"Many projects though not all are initiated based on a business case [which provides the justification for starting the project]. Projects may be initiated due to any identified need to deliver or modify a process product or service such as contracts statements of work or other documents [by addressing specific requirements or improvements]. In all cases the project intent is to provide the desired outcome that addresses the need with a valued solution [by delivering results that meet the identified need]. A business case can contain information about strategic alignment assessment of risk exposure economic feasibility study return on investments expected key performance measures evaluations and alternative approaches [by including detailed analysis and planning].",
			"The business case may state the intended value contribution of the project outcome in qualitative or quantitative terms or both [by describing the expected benefits in measurable or descriptive ways]. A business case contains at least these supporting and interrelated elements:",
			"▶ Business need. Business provides the rationale for the project explaining why the project is undertaken [by outlining the reasons and goals behind the project]. It originates with the preliminary business requirements which are reflected in the project charter or other authorizing document [by starting with initial needs and formalizing them in official documents]. It provides details about the business goals and objectives [by specifying what the project aims to achieve]. The business need may be intended for the performing organization a client organization a partnership of organizations or public welfare [by targeting different beneficiaries]. A clear statement of the business need helps the project team understand the business drivers for the future state and allows the project team to identify opportunities or problems to increase the potential value from the project outcome [by clarifying the reasons and goals to guide the team's efforts].",
			"▶ Project justification. Project justification is connected to business need [by linking the reasons for the project to its goals]. It explains why the business need is worth the investment and why it should be addressed at this time [by providing a rationale for the project's timing and value]. The project justification is accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis and assumptions [by including financial analysis and underlying assumptions].",
			"▶ Business strategy. Business strategy is the reason for the project and all needs are related to the strategy to achieve the value [by aligning the project's goals with the organization's overall strategy].",
			"Together the business need project justification and business strategy in addition to benefits and possible agreements provide the project team with information that allows them to make informed decisions to meet or exceed the intended business value [by giving them a clear understanding of the project's purpose and goals].",
			"Desired outcomes should be clearly described iteratively assessed and updated throughout the project [by defining what success looks like regularly reviewing progress and making necessary adjustments]. During its life cycle a project may undergo change and the project team then adapts in response [by being flexible and responsive to new information or circumstances]. The project team continuously evaluates project progress and direction against the desired outputs baselines and business case to confirm that the project remains aligned to the need and will deliver its intended outcomes [by regularly checking if the project is on track to meet its goals]. Alternatively the business case is updated to capture an opportunity or minimize a problem identified by the project team and other stakeholders [by revising the project's plan to take advantage of new opportunities or address issues]. If the project or its stakeholders are no longer aligned with the business need or if the project seems unlikely to provide the intended value the organization may choose to terminate the effort [by deciding to stop the project if it no longer meets its goals or provides value].",
			"Value is the worth importance or usefulness of something [by measuring how beneficial or significant it is]. Value is subjective in the sense that the same concept can have different values for different people and organizations [as different stakeholders may see the project's benefits differently]. This occurs because what is considered a benefit depends on organizational strategies ranging from short-term financial gains long-term gains and even nonfinancial elements [by considering various types of benefits based on the organization's goals]. Because all projects have a range of stakeholders different values generated for each group of stakeholders have to be considered and balanced with the whole while placing a priority on the customer perspective [by ensuring that the project's benefits are balanced and focused on meeting customer needs].",
			"Within the context of some projects there may be different forms of value engineering that maximize value to the customer to the performing organization or other stakeholders [by optimizing resources and processes to deliver the best possible outcomes]. An example of this includes delivering the required functionality and level of quality with an acceptable risk exposure while using as few resources as possible and by avoiding waste [by ensuring efficiency and minimizing unnecessary costs]. Sometimes especially in adaptive projects that do not have a fixed up-front scope the project team can optimize value by working with the customer to determine which features are worth investment and which may not be valuable enough to be added to the output [by collaborating with customers to prioritize the most beneficial features].",
			"To support value realization from projects project teams shift focus from deliverables to the intended outcomes [by concentrating on the overall goals rather than just the specific outputs]. Doing so allows project teams to deliver on the vision or purpose of the project rather than simply creating a specific deliverable [by ensuring the project achieves its broader objectives]. While the deliverable may support the intended project outcome it may not fully achieve the vision or purpose of the project [as the output alone might not meet all the project's goals]. For example customers may want a specific software solution because they think that the solution resolves the business need for higher productivity [by believing the software will improve efficiency]. The software is the output of the project but the software itself does not enable the productivity outcome that is intended [as the tool alone might not lead to better productivity]. In this case adding a new deliverable of training and coaching on the use of the software can enable a better productivity outcome [by providing additional support to ensure effective use of the software]. If the project’s output fails to enable higher productivity stakeholders may feel that the project has failed [as the intended benefit was not achieved]. Thus project teams and other stakeholders understand both the deliverable and the intended outcome from the deliverable [by recognizing the importance of both the output and its impact].",
			"The value contribution of project work could be a short- or long-term measure [by considering both immediate and future benefits]. Because value contribution may be mixed with contributions from operational activities it may be difficult to isolate [as it can be challenging to separate project benefits from ongoing operations]. When the project is a component of a program evaluation of value at the program level may also be necessary to properly direct the project [by assessing the project's impact within the larger program]. A reliable evaluation of value should consider the whole context and the entire life cycle of the project’s output [by taking into account all factors and the long-term effects]. While value is realized over time effective processes can enable early benefit realization [by implementing efficient methods to achieve benefits sooner]. With efficient and effective implementation project teams may demonstrate or achieve such outcomes as prioritized delivery better customer service or an improved work environment [by showing tangible improvements in key areas]. By working with organizational leaders who are responsible for putting project deliverables into use project leaders can make sure that the deliverables are positioned to realize the planned outcomes [by collaborating with leaders to ensure successful implementation].",
			"Recognize evaluate and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surrounding the project in a holistic way to positively affect project performance [by considering all aspects and their interactions to improve outcomes]. A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity [meaning various parts work together and influence each other]. Systems thinking entails taking a holistic view of how project parts interact with each other and with external systems [by understanding the connections and relationships within the project and its environment]. Systems are constantly changing requiring consistent attention to internal and external conditions [by monitoring and adapting to ongoing changes].",
			"Being responsive to system interactions allows project teams to leverage positive outcomes [by taking advantage of beneficial interactions]. A system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified whole [by working together to achieve a common goal]. Taking a holistic view a project is a multifaceted entity that exists in dynamic circumstances exhibiting the characteristics of a system [by recognizing the complexity and changing nature of the project]. Project teams should acknowledge this holistic view of a project seeing the project as a system with its own working parts [by understanding the project as an interconnected whole].",
			"A project works within other larger systems and a project deliverable may become part of a larger system to realize benefits [by contributing to broader goals]. For example projects may be part of a program which in turn may also be part of a portfolio [by being components of larger initiatives]. These interconnected structures are known as a system of systems [by forming a network of related projects and programs]. Project teams balance inside/out and outside/in perspectives to support alignment across the system of systems [by considering both internal and external factors to ensure coherence].",
			"The project may also have subsystems that are required to integrate effectively to deliver the intended outcome [by ensuring all parts work together smoothly]. For example when individual project teams develop separate components of a deliverable all components should integrate effectively [by coordinating efforts to create a cohesive final product]. This requires project teams to interact and align subsystem work on a regular basis [by maintaining communication and collaboration to ensure alignment].",
			"Systems thinking also considers timing elements of systems such as what the project delivers or enables over time [by recognizing how the project's outputs evolve and build upon each other]. For example if project deliverables are released incrementally each increment expands the cumulative outcomes or capabilities of previous versions [by adding new features or improvements step by step]. Project teams should think beyond the end of the project to the operational state of the project’s deliverable so that intended outcomes are realized [by planning for how the deliverables will be used and maintained after the project ends].",
			"As projects unfold internal and external conditions are continuously changing [by adapting to new information and circumstances]. A single change can create several impacts [by causing a ripple effect throughout the project]. For example on a large construction project a change in requirements can cause contractual changes with the primary contractor subcontractors suppliers or others [by altering agreements and responsibilities]. In turn those changes can create an impact on project cost schedule scope and performance [by affecting the budget timeline and quality]. Subsequently these changes could invoke a change control protocol for obtaining approvals from entities in external systems such as the service providers regulators financiers and government authorities [by requiring formal approval from various stakeholders].",
			"While it is possible to predict some of the changes in advance many of the changes that can impact the project during its life cycle emerge in real time [by dealing with unforeseen issues as they arise]. With systems thinking including constant attention to internal and external conditions the project team can navigate a wide spectrum of changes and impacts to keep the project in agreement with the relevant stakeholders [by staying flexible and responsive to maintain alignment with stakeholder needs].",
			"Systems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within the project system [by understanding their role and relationships within the project]. The project system often brings together a diverse project team engaged in working for a common objective [by uniting different individuals to achieve shared goals]. This diversity brings value to project teams but they need to consider how to leverage those differences effectively so that the project team works cohesively [by using diverse perspectives to enhance teamwork and performance]. For example if a government agency contracts with a private company for development of a new technology the development team may consist of project team members from both organizations [by combining public and private sector expertise]. Those project team members may have assumptions ways of working and mental models related to how they function within their home organization [by bringing their own experiences and practices]. In this new project system which combines the cultures of a private company and a government agency the project team members can establish a synthesized team culture that creates a common vision language and toolset [by developing a unified approach and shared tools]. This can help project team members to engage and contribute effectively and help to increase the probability that the project system works [by fostering collaboration and improving the chances of success].",
			"Because of the interactivity among systems project teams should operate with awareness of and vigilance toward changing system dynamics [by staying alert to how different parts of the project and its environment interact and change]. The following skills support a systems view of the project:",
			"▶ Empathy with the business areas [by understanding and considering the needs and perspectives of different business units].",
			"▶ Critical thinking with a big picture focus [by analyzing situations thoughtfully while keeping the overall project goals in mind].",
			"▶ Challenging of assumptions and mental models [by questioning existing beliefs and approaches to find better solutions].",
			"▶ Seeking external review and advice [by consulting with outside experts to gain new insights and perspectives].",
			"▶ Use of integrated methods artifacts and practices so there is a common understanding of project work deliverables and outcomes [by using standardized tools and processes to ensure everyone is on the same page].",
			"▶ Use of modeling and scenarios to envision how system dynamics may interact and react [by creating simulations to predict and understand potential changes and their impacts].",
			"▶ Proactive management of the integration to help achieve business outcomes [by actively coordinating different parts of the project to ensure they work together effectively].",
			"Recognizing evaluating and responding to system interactions can lead to the following positive outcomes:",
			"▶ Early consideration of uncertainty and risk within the project exploration of alternatives and consideration of unintended consequences [by identifying potential issues and exploring different options early on].",
			"▶ Ability to adjust assumptions and plans throughout the project life cycle [by being flexible and updating plans as new information becomes available].",
			"▶ Provision of ongoing information and insights that inform planning and delivery [by continuously gathering and sharing data to guide decision-making].",
			"▶ Clear communication of plans progress and projections to relevant stakeholders [by keeping everyone informed about the project's status and future direction].",
			"▶ Alignment of project goals and objectives to the customer organization’s goals objectives and vision [by ensuring the project supports the broader organizational aims].",
			"▶ Ability to adjust to the changing needs of the end user sponsor or customer of the project deliverables [by being responsive to stakeholder requirements and feedback].",
			"▶ Ability to see synergies and savings between aligned projects or initiatives [by identifying opportunities for collaboration and cost savings].",
			"▶ Ability to exploit opportunities not otherwise captured or see threats posed to or by other projects or initiatives [by recognizing and leveraging new opportunities or addressing potential risks].",
			"▶ Clarity regarding the best project performance measurement and their influence on the behavior of the people involved in the project [by selecting appropriate metrics that drive desired behaviors].",
			"▶ Decisions that benefit the organization as a whole [by making choices that support the overall success of the organization].",
			"▶ More comprehensive and informed identification of risks [by thoroughly understanding and assessing potential threats to the project].",
			"LEADERSHIP",
			"Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes [by guiding the team towards achieving their goals and ensuring smooth project execution]. Any project team member can demonstrate leadership behaviors [by taking initiative and influencing others positively]. Leadership is different than authority [as it involves inspiring and motivating others rather than just giving orders]. Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation [by being flexible and responsive to the needs of the team and the project]. Effective leaders recognize differences in motivation among project team members [by understanding what drives each individual and tailoring their approach accordingly]. Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of honesty integrity and ethical conduct [by setting a positive example for others to follow].",
			"Projects create a unique need for effective leadership [due to their complexity and the involvement of various stakeholders]. Unlike general business operations where roles and responsibilities are often established and consistent projects often involve multiple organizations departments functions or vendors that do not interact on a regular basis [by bringing together diverse groups that may not usually work together]. Moreover projects may carry higher stakes and expectations than regular operational functions [by having significant goals and pressures]. As a result a broader array of managers executives senior contributors and other stakeholders attempt to influence a project [by having more people involved in decision-making]. This often creates higher degrees of confusion and conflict [by leading to misunderstandings and disagreements]. Consequently higher-performing projects demonstrate effective leadership behaviors more frequently and from more people than most projects [by having strong leadership from multiple team members].",
			"A project environment that prioritizes vision creativity motivation enthusiasm encouragement and empathy can support better outcomes [by fostering a positive and productive atmosphere]. These traits are often associated with leadership [by being key qualities of effective leaders]. Leadership comprises the attitude talent character and behaviors to influence individuals within and outside the project team toward the desired outcomes [by using personal qualities and actions to guide and inspire others].",
			"Leadership is not exclusive to any specific role [meaning anyone can exhibit leadership qualities regardless of their position]. High-performing projects may feature multiple people exhibiting effective leadership skills for example the project manager sponsors stakeholders senior management or even project team members [by having various individuals demonstrating leadership]. Anyone working on a project can demonstrate effective leadership traits styles and skills to help the project team perform and deliver the required results [by contributing to the team's success through their leadership abilities].",
			"It is important to note that more conflict and confusion can emerge when too many participants attempt to exert project influence in multiple misaligned directions [by causing misunderstandings and disagreements]. However higher-performing projects show a paradoxical combination of more influencers each contributing more leadership skills in a complementary fashion [by having multiple leaders working together effectively]. For example: if a sponsor articulates clear priorities then a technical lead opens the discussion for delivery options where individual contributors assert pros and cons until the project manager brings the conversation to a consensus strategy [by having different leaders guide the team through various stages of decision-making]. Successful leadership enables someone to influence motivate direct and coach people under any condition [by guiding and supporting the team in any situation]. It also incorporates characteristics derived from an organization’s culture and practices [by reflecting the organization's values and norms].",
			"Leadership should not be confused with authority which is the position of control given to individuals within an organization to foster overall effective and efficient function [by distinguishing between leadership and formal power]. Authority is the right to exercise power [by having the official capacity to make decisions]. Authority is usually delegated to a person by formal means such as a charter document or designated title [by being assigned through official channels]. This person may then have a role or position description that indicates their authority [by having a defined scope of power]. Authority denotes accountability for certain activities actions of individuals or decision making in certain circumstances [by being responsible for specific tasks and decisions]. While individuals may use their authority to influence motivate direct others or act when others do not perform or act as directed or requested this is not the same as leadership [by recognizing that authority alone does not equate to leadership]. For example organizational executives may grant someone the authority to form a project team to deliver an outcome [by giving them the power to assemble a team]. However authority alone is insufficient [by acknowledging that power is not enough]. It takes leadership to motivate a group toward a common goal influence them to align their individual interests in favor of collective effort and achieve success as a project team rather than as individuals [by inspiring and guiding the team to work together towards shared objectives].",
			"Effective leadership draws from or combines elements of various styles of leadership [by using different approaches depending on the situation]. Documented leadership styles range from autocratic democratic laissez-faire directive participative assertive supportive and autocratic to consensus [by including a variety of methods such as authoritative collaborative hands-off and others]. Of all these no single leadership style has proven to be the universally best or recommended approach [by recognizing that different situations require different styles]. Instead effective leadership is shown when it best fits a given situation [by adapting to the specific needs of the moment]. For example:",
			"▶ In moments of chaos directive action creates more clarity and momentum than collaborative problem solving [by providing clear guidance and quick decisions in times of confusion].",
			"▶ For environments with highly competent and engaged staff empowered delegation elicits more productivity than centralized coordination [by giving skilled team members the freedom to take initiative].",
			"When senior managers suffer conflict over priorities neutral facilitation helps more than detailed recommendations [by mediating disputes rather than dictating solutions]. Effective leadership skill is grown [by developing and improving leadership abilities over time]. It can be learned and developed so that it becomes a professional asset to the individual as well as a benefit to the project and its stakeholders [by enhancing personal and project success]. High-performing projects show a pervasive pattern of continuous improvement down to the personal level [by constantly striving for better performance]. A project team member deepens leadership acumen by adding or practicing a combination of various skills or techniques including but not limited to:",
			"▶ Focusing a project team around agreed goals [by aligning everyone towards common objectives]",
			"▶ Articulating a motivating vision for the project outcomes [by inspiring the team with a clear and compelling goal]",
			"▶ Seeking resources and support for the project [by ensuring the team has what it needs to succeed]",
			"▶ Generating consensus on the best way forward [by facilitating agreement on the project's direction]",
			"▶ Overcoming obstacles to project progress [by addressing and resolving issues that hinder progress]",
			"▶ Negotiating and resolving conflict within the project team and between the project team and other stakeholders [by managing disputes effectively]",
			"▶ Adapting communication style and messaging so that they are relevant to the audience [by tailoring communication to different stakeholders]",
			"▶ Coaching and mentoring fellow project team members [by providing guidance and support to others]",
			"▶ Appreciating and rewarding positive behaviors and contributions [by recognizing and celebrating achievements]",
			"▶ Providing opportunities for skill growth and development [by encouraging continuous learning]",
			"▶ Facilitating collaborative decision making [by involving the team in important decisions]",
			"▶ Employing effective conversations and active listening [by communicating clearly and listening attentively]",
			"▶ Empowering project team members and delegating responsibilities to them [by giving team members the authority to take action]",
			"▶ Building a cohesive project team that takes responsibility [by fostering teamwork and accountability]",
			"▶ Showing empathy for project team and stakeholder perspectives [by understanding and considering others' viewpoints]",
			"▶ Having self-awareness of one’s own bias and behaviors [by being mindful of personal attitudes and actions]",
			"▶ Managing and adapting to change during the project life cycle [by being flexible and responsive to new developments]",
			"▶ Facilitating a fail-fast/learn quickly mindset by acknowledging mistakes [by encouraging quick learning from errors] and",
			"▶ Role modeling of desired behaviors [by setting a positive example for others to follow].",
			"Personal character matters in a leader [by influencing how others perceive and trust them]. A person may have strong ability in leadership skills but then have their influence undermined by the perception of being self-serving or untrustworthy [by losing credibility if seen as selfish or dishonest]. Effective leaders seek to be a role model in areas of honesty integrity and ethical conduct [by demonstrating high moral standards]. Effective leaders focus on being transparent behave unselfishly and are able to ask for help [by being open selfless and willing to seek assistance]. Effective leaders understand that project team members scrutinize and emulate the values ethics and behaviors that leaders exhibit [by recognizing that their actions set an example for others]. Therefore leaders have an additional responsibility to demonstrate expected behaviors through their actions [by acting in ways that reflect the desired values].",
			"Projects work best when leaders understand what motivates people [by knowing what drives team members]. Project teams can thrive when project team members use appropriate leadership traits skills and characteristics that match the specific needs and expectations of stakeholders [by aligning their approach with stakeholder requirements]. Knowing how to best communicate with or motivate people or take action when required can help improve project team performance and manage obstacles to project success [by enhancing team effectiveness and overcoming challenges]. When practiced by more than one person on a project leadership can foster shared responsibility toward the project goal which in turn can foster a healthy and vibrant environment [by promoting collective ownership and a positive atmosphere]. Motivators include such forces as finances recognition autonomy compelling purpose growth opportunity and personal contribution [by considering various factors that inspire team members].",
			"Effective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes [by guiding the team towards achieving their goals]. Project teams individual project team members and other stakeholders are engaged throughout a well-led project [by involving everyone in the process]. Each project team member can focus on delivering results using a common vision and working toward shared outcomes [by aligning efforts towards the same goals]. Effective leadership is essential in helping project teams maintain an ethical and adaptable environment [by fostering a culture of integrity and flexibility].",
			"Additionally business obligations can be fulfilled based on delegated responsibility and authority [by ensuring tasks are assigned and managed effectively]. Shared leadership does not undermine or diminish the role or authority of a leader designated by the organization nor does it diminish the need for that leader to apply the right leadership style and skills at the right time [by complementing rather than replacing formal leadership roles]. By blending styles continuing skill growth and leveraging motivators any project team member or stakeholder can motivate influence coach and grow the project team regardless of role or position [by using a mix of approaches and ongoing development to enhance team performance].",
			"TAILORING",
			"Each project is unique [by having its own specific characteristics and requirements]. Project success is based on adapting to the unique context of the project to determine the most appropriate methods of producing the desired outcomes [by customizing the approach to fit the project's specific needs]. Tailoring the approach is iterative and therefore is a continuous process throughout the project [by regularly adjusting the methods as the project progresses].",
			"Design the project development approach based on the context of the project its objectives stakeholders governance and the environment using “just enough” process to achieve the desired outcome while maximizing value managing cost and enhancing speed [by creating a tailored plan that balances efficiency and effectiveness]. Adapting to the unique objectives stakeholders and complexity of the environment contributes to project success [by ensuring the approach fits the project's specific goals and challenges]. Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of approach governance and processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and the work at hand [by intentionally customizing methods to better suit the project's context]. Project teams tailor the appropriate framework that will enable the flexibility to consistently produce positive outcomes within the context of the life cycle of the project [by choosing a flexible structure that supports ongoing success].",
			"The business environment team size degree of uncertainty and complexity of the project all factor into how project systems are tailored [by considering various elements that influence the project's approach]. Project systems can be tailored with a holistic perspective including the consideration of interrelated complexities [by taking into account all interconnected factors]. Tailoring aims to maximize value manage constraints and improve performance by using “just enough” processes methods templates and artifacts to achieve the desired outcome from the project [by applying the minimum necessary tools and techniques to achieve success].",
			"Together with the PMO and considering governance project teams discuss and decide on the delivery approach and resources required for producing outcomes on a project-by-project basis [by collaborating with the Project Management Office and following governance guidelines to plan the project's execution]. This includes the selection of the processes to use development approach methods and artifacts needed to deliver the project outcomes [by choosing the appropriate tools and techniques for the project]. Tailoring decisions can be an implicit action of accepting an established methodology [by following a pre-defined approach]. Conversely tailoring can be an explicit action of selecting and mixing specific elements to suit the unique characteristics of the project and the project environment [by customizing the approach to fit the project's specific needs]. Tailoring is necessary to some degree in every project because each project exists in a particular context [by recognizing that each project has its own unique circumstances].",
			"Projects are often unique even when the deliverable of the project does not seem unique [by having distinct contexts and requirements]. This is because project contexts differ in that the organization its customers its channels and its environment are dynamic elements [by considering the varying factors that influence each project]. Those changes and ongoing learning may cause project teams to use or develop different methods or approaches in pursuit of success [by adapting to new information and circumstances]. The project team should examine the unique set of conditions for each project so that they can determine the most appropriate methods of producing the desired outcomes [by assessing the specific factors that affect the project].",
			"An existing methodology or common way of working can inform the way in which a project is tailored [by using established practices as a starting point]. A methodology is a system of practices techniques procedures and rules used by those who work in a discipline [by providing a structured approach to project work]. Project teams may be required to assume the methodology of the parent organization [by following the organization's standard processes]. That is the project team adopts a system of processes governance methods and templates that provide guidance on how to run the project [by using the organization's established framework]. While this provides a degree of consistency to projects within an organization the methodology itself may still need tailoring to suit each project [by customizing the approach to fit the project's specific needs]. Organizational policies and procedures prescribe authorized boundaries within which the project team can tailor [by setting limits on how much the approach can be customized].",
			"Project teams can also factor in the time and cost of project management processes [by considering the resources required for managing the project]. Processes that are not tailored may add little value to the project or its outcomes while increasing cost and lengthening schedule [by being inefficient and costly]. Tailoring the approach along with appropriate processes methods and artifacts can help project teams make decisions about process-related costs and the related value contribution to project outcomes [by optimizing the approach to balance cost and value].",
			"In addition to deciding on how to tailor an approach project teams communicate the tailoring decisions to stakeholders associated with that approach [by informing relevant parties about the chosen methods]. Each member of the project team is aware of the chosen methods and processes that relate to those stakeholders and their role [by ensuring everyone understands their responsibilities and the project's approach].",
			"Tailoring the project approach to suit the unique characteristics of the project and its environment can contribute to a higher level of project performance and an increased probability of success [by customizing the methods to fit the specific needs and context of the project]. A tailored project approach can produce direct and indirect benefits to organizations such as:",
			"▶ Deeper commitment from project team members because they took part in defining the approach [by involving team members in the planning process increasing their engagement and ownership]",
			"▶ Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources [by eliminating unnecessary steps and optimizing resource use]",
			"▶ Customer-oriented focus as the needs of the customer and other stakeholders are an important influencing factor in the tailoring of the project [by prioritizing the requirements and expectations of stakeholders] and",
			"▶ More efficient use of project resources as project teams are conscious of the weight of project processes [by being mindful of the impact of processes on resources and time].",
			"Tailoring projects can lead to the following positive outcomes:",
			"▶ Increased innovation efficiency and productivity [by fostering creativity and improving performance]",
			"▶ Lessons learned so that improvements from a specific delivery approach can be shared and applied to the next round of work or future projects [by capturing and utilizing knowledge gained]",
			"▶ Further improvement of an organization’s methodology with new practices methods and artifacts [by enhancing the overall approach with new insights]",
			"▶ Discovery of improved outcomes processes or methods through experimentation [by finding better ways to achieve goals]",
			"▶ Effective integration within multidisciplinary project teams of methods and practices used to deliver project results [by coordinating different approaches to achieve cohesive results] and",
			"▶ Increased adaptability for the organization in the long term [by building flexibility and resilience].",
			"Tailoring an approach is iterative in nature and therefore is a constant process itself during the project life cycle [by continuously refining and adjusting the methods]. Project teams collect feedback from all stakeholders on how the methods and tailored processes are working for them as the project progresses to evaluate their effectiveness and add value to the organization [by regularly assessing and improving the approach based on stakeholder input].",
			"BUILD QUALITY INTO PROCESSES AND DELIVERABLES",
			"Maintain a focus on quality that produces deliverables that meet project objectives and align to the needs uses and acceptance requirements set forth by relevant stakeholders [by ensuring that the outputs of the project satisfy the expectations and requirements of those involved]. Project quality entails satisfying stakeholders’ expectations and fulfilling project and product requirements [by meeting the standards and needs defined by stakeholders]. Quality focuses on meeting acceptance criteria for deliverables [by ensuring that the project's outputs meet the agreed-upon standards].",
			"Project quality entails ensuring project processes are appropriate and as effective as possible [by optimizing the methods used to achieve the project's goals]. Quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of a product service or result fulfills the requirements [by measuring how well the project's outputs meet the defined standards]. Quality includes the ability to satisfy the customer’s stated or implied needs [by ensuring that the deliverables meet both explicit and implicit expectations]. The product service or result of a project (referred to here as deliverables) is measured for the quality of both the conformance to acceptance criteria and fitness for use [by evaluating how well the outputs meet the specified standards and how suitable they are for their intended purpose].",
			"Quality may have several different dimensions including but not limited to the following:",
			"▶ Performance. Does the deliverable function as the project team and other stakeholders intended? [by checking if it works as expected].",
			"▶ Conformity. Is the deliverable fit for use and does it meet the specifications? [by ensuring it matches the required standards].",
			"▶ Reliability. Does the deliverable produce consistent metrics each time it is performed or produced? [by verifying it delivers the same results consistently].",
			"▶ Resilience. Is the deliverable able to cope with unforeseen failures and quickly recover? [by assessing its ability to handle unexpected issues].",
			"▶ Satisfaction. Does the deliverable elicit positive feedback from end users? This includes usability and user experience [by measuring user satisfaction and ease of use].",
			"▶ Uniformity. Does the deliverable show parity with other deliverables produced in the same manner? [by ensuring consistency across similar outputs].",
			"▶ Efficiency. Does the deliverable produce the greatest output with the least amount of inputs and effort? [by evaluating its productivity and resource usage].",
			"▶ Sustainability. Does the deliverable produce a positive impact on economic social and environmental parameters? [by considering its long-term benefits and impact].",
			"Project teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria based on requirements [by using specific standards to evaluate quality]. A requirement is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product service or result to satisfy a need [by defining what is needed for success]. Requirements either explicit or implicit may come from stakeholders a contract organizational policies standards or regulatory bodies or a combination of these [by considering various sources of requirements]. Quality is closely linked to the product acceptance criteria as described in the statement of work or other design documents [by aligning with the defined standards]. These criteria should be updated as experimentation and prioritization occur and validated as part of the acceptance process [by regularly reviewing and confirming the standards].",
			"Quality is also relevant to the project approaches and activities used to produce the project’s deliverables [by ensuring the methods used are effective]. While project teams evaluate the quality of a deliverable through inspection and testing project activities and processes are assessed through reviews and audits [by checking both the outputs and the processes]. In both instances quality activities may focus on detection and prevention of errors and defects [by identifying and addressing issues early]."
