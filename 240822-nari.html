    <h1>～なり…なり Grammar Explanation</h1>
    <p>
        The ～なり…なり pattern is used to indicate that either of the options mentioned is acceptable, and that something should be done. It gives the listener or reader options and shows that multiple actions or choices are acceptable, which can lead to a particular outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example:<br>
        コーヒーなり、お茶なり、好きな方を選んでください。<br>
        Either coffee or tea, please choose whichever you like.
    </p>
    <p>
        This pattern is similar to saying "either… or…" in English, emphasizing that any of the mentioned options is fine and encourages action based on those options.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the pattern is quite structured, a more casual expression might be "～てもいいし…てもいい", which also indicates that either option is fine but in a less formal way.
